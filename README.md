# Cryeator

A content community where creators can directly earn from their content when others like their content. I have seen some instance when someone needs contributions and need to go create a gofundme page to accept donation. The main goal of this token is to open the door for all creator to earn from their content directly.


## How does it work?

When you see content that you would like to support its creator, you like the user post, the process of liking the content, you get the option of "normal" or "web3" like, when you select the web3 option, you have the option to enter any amount you would like to send to the creator post.

The token will be sent directly to the user's post, which the user can withdraw instantly without the traditional web2 drawbacks like waiting for X duration for the bank to process the receiving amount.
